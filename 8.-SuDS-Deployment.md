## Tutorial Overview

It is recommended that a location is determined prior to install to determine the depth of the drain that the pressure logger is in and whether or not the communications gateway will have access to power. This wiki provides a checklist of equipment to bring and tasks to complete before going out in the field. It will walk you through how to determine the optimal location for installation, and the installation process itself. 

## Deployment Field Kit
* Sensors:
    * Communication Gateway box (with pole mounting kit installed and labels placed)
    * Hardware for pole mounting (bring stainless steel hose clamps of assorted sizes)
    * Pressure Logger (with labels on PVC housing, and battery pack installed) 

* Tech:
    * Field Laptop (plus charger) and Notebook 
    * Monitor including adapter (such as this [one](https://www.asus.com/us/Displays-Desktops/Monitors/ZenScreen/ZenScreen-MB16AC/)), and keyboard and mouse 
    * RTK GPS + chargers 
    * extension cords (e.g., 12 ft) 
    * USB-C cord (in case we need to talk to sensor directly) 
    * Micro-HDMI to Micro-HDMI / HDMI (depending on what the monitor accepts) cable 
    * Additional OLA wiring and components
* Toolbox:
    * General tools: assorted hand tools, cordless driver (5/16 bit), measuring tape, hex keys set (metric and English)/multitool, electrical tape, sharpie, scissors, needle nose pliers
    * PVC supplies: PVC cutter, ½” coupler, PVC primer, PVC Cement (e.g., for sensor length adjustment in the field), super lube, hose clamps and spare hose clamps, zip ties and/or electrical tape to tidy power cord, tape measurer, voltmeter (to check for power) 
    * Field solder supplies: heat gun, heat shrink kit, solder pieces, anti-static mat 
* Health and Safety:
    * Traffic cones, safety vests, gloves, table, chairs, hand towel, paper towels, medical emergency kit 
* Large Items:
    * Ladder, grate-lifting tool, crowbar, tool belt, bucket 

## Location Scouting 

* Analyze the grate and grate in relation to pole. Note anything that will block the camera's view (e.g., flags, trees). Take photos for documentation. 
* Regarding the power supply on the pole, confirm that power is turned on and will supply power at all times.
* Test Bluetooth connection, if possible. 
* IRB Wi-Fi in-person handouts, check office hours of local businesses for install day. 


## Prior to Installation
After choosing your installation site from location scouting, do the following to prepare for installation day:
* Label Communications Gateway box and sensor; add components to catalog spreadsheet  
* Set up database to receive data 
* Verify Communications Gateway box settings in ~/bin/config.ini, dataHandler.sh, webcam.sh 
* Check for public WiFi and/or reach out locally to request use (if no WiFi, it will require a return trip when we get access) 
* Test sensor connection over Bluetooth 
* Program sensor settings 
* Remove large sensor test files (system will download all to catch up using a lot of battery) 
* Fully charge sensor battery 
* Practice gateway installation on a nearby pole. 
* Run a 24 hour calibration test for the probe about to be installed. 
* Check that the pi can communicate with the sensor and connect to wifi. 
* Check that the strut for the gateway is aligned correctly. 

## Communications Gateway Installation 

**To be updated for V2 technology**

* Once on-site, establish WiFi connectivity. 
    * Enable cellphone hotspot so Pi can connect to it.
    * Connect field laptop to local WiFi (best) or cell hotspot.
    * Plug in the Gateway to an outlet.
    * Connect external monitor via micro-HDMI to Pi. Connect mouse and keyboard to Pi via USB.
    * Open and hold power button for 4-5 seconds to power on Gateway (power button is small button on far side of micro-USB connector).

_Connecting the Communications Gateway to a monitor while in the field_

* Complete the first two steps in the pressure sensor installation guide below.
* Test that the pressure sensor is connected to the Gateway over Bluetooth. The Bluetooth symbol on Pi screen should be green if connected.

* Install Gateway on pole.

## Gateway Installation 

Gather the following materials: 

* Gateway Enclosure (with 2x vertical and 1x horizontal strutting) (1)
* Gateway Mounting Frame (with 2x vertical and 2x horizontal strutting) (1)
* Horizontal strutting (Note: all horizontal member lengths are site-specific. (2)
* Threaded rod (4) 
* 3/8”-16 Hex Nut (12) 
* 3/8” Split Lock Washer (28) 
* 3/8” Flat Washer (28) 
* 3/8”-16 1” Bolt (4) 
* Strut Channel Nut (4) 
* Galvanized Conduit (1) 
* 5/16”-18 Carriage Bolt (2) 
* 5/16”-18 Hex Nut (2) 
* 5/16” Flat Washer (2) 
* 5/16” Split Lock Washer (2) 

First, confirm that the longer vertical member of the gateway enclosure is on the desired side. Next, place 4x threaded rods through the gateway mounting frame. One on each side of each horizontal member. Fasten each threaded rod to gateway mounting frame with 2x 3/8” flat washers, 2x 3/8” split lock washers, and 2x 3/8” hex nuts. This will prevent the rods from falling out while moving the mounting frame. Place 2x 3/8” bolt each with 1x 3/8” flat washer and 1x 3/8” split lock washer through each horizontal strut at the same width as the strut channels fastened to the back of the
gateway enclosure. **This is Step 4**. Following, partially fasten each bolt in place using 1x strut channel nut. Only thread each nut far enough that they will not come off while being moved (i.e., leave enough space for the nuts to slide into a strut channel).

After that, hoist mounting frame, 4x 3/8” hex nuts, 4x 3/8” flat washers, 4x 3/8” split lock washers, and 2x horizontal strutting to the desired height. Installer 1 holds the mounting frame in the desired place. Remember, this will be the back of the gateway; so, the mounting frame should be on the opposite side of the pole from the desired enclosure location (i.e., the person holding the frame will be facing the direction that the camera will be facing). Installer 1 holds the mounting frame in the desired place. Remember, this will be the back of the gateway; so, the mounting frame should be on the opposite side of the pole from the desired enclosure location (i.e., the person holding the frame will be facing the direction that the camera will be facing). **This is Step 7**. Installer 2 should then fasten each rod into place with 1x 3/8” flat washers, 1x 3/8” split lock washers, 1x 3/8” hex nuts in this order. All four rods should be tightened until the gateway mounting frame is securely fastened to the pole (i.e., capable of holding the enclosure). **This is Step 8**. Finally, hoist the gateway enclosure into place. 

Then, Installer 2 slides the vertical struts over the partially fastened strut channel nuts from Step 4. Installer 1 can assist in ensuring the channel nuts slide properly into the vertical strutting. The gateway enclosure is in place when the horizontal strut on the back of the enclosure lies against the top horizontal strutting installed in Steps 7 and 8. Installer 1 tightens the bolts on the backs of the two horizontal struts installed by
Installer 2 in Steps 7 and 8.

At this point, confirm that the gateway enclosure is now securely mounted to the pole. Installer 2 should fasten the conduit to the longer vertical member of the gateway enclosure using 2x 5/16” carriage Bolt, 2x 5/16” hex nut, 2x 5/16” flat washer, and 2x 5/16” split lock washer. The carriage bolt should be thread through the back so that the nuts are tightened in the front of the gateway.

Other items to note: 

* Install and tighten the solar panel arm to the conduit piece before hoisting and installing
the conduit.
* Hoist and place the battery as the last step. For wiring, the controller labels starting at the far left are solar positive, solar negative, battery positive, battery negative.

* Aim, focus and set zoom on camera. See Gateway Setup Wiki for detailed instructions.
    * Check camera field of view by typing ``camera``, which is an alias, into terminal and hitting enter.
* Run site enable program by running command ``sudo site-enable.sh`` in terminal.
    * Within ``site-enable.sh``: when testing connection between the Gateway and the pressure sensor, **only enable data and image collection** or option 1 and option 3.
        * Enter ``slog`` (serial log) into terminal (another alias); you should see sensor data transmitted to the Gateway that looks like the image below. This is the data stream from the pressure sensor (e.g., pressure and temperature readings in the third and second columns from the right). Verify these values to make sure they make sense, but note the if the sensor is on it's side or upside down the pressure sensor may return negative values.

* Verify that the date/time and sampling rates are correct in the data stream.
* If you selected write data and photos to cloud during site-enable, you may not see the expected OLA data stream which should show every measurement taken. Instead you would see something like the image below. The OLA is stuck in the download menu and will continue to get stuck there after taking measurements until the database has been properly configured to incorporate data from the new location.
