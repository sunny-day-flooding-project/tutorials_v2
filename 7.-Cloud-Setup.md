## Tutorial Overview 
This page walks through how to set up cloud components for the Sunny Day Flooding Sensors (SuDS) framework. 

## Equipment List
Access to a computer, with applications for running Python or R code.

## Overview of Tools

### Main tools
The SuDS framework relies on a few tools that require users to sign up and create accounts:

### Other tools

Most code required for SuDS is written in R or Python, so be sure to have those languages and any IDEs (integrated development environments) installed on your local machine for testing/debugging. For R, we recommend [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), and for Python, we like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

To connect to the Postgres database that will be created in OpenShift, it is helpful to have [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org) or some other database management software installed on your local machine. Openshift [Command Line tools](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) are needed to set up port forwarding and access the database.

The repos that are built into Docker containers include a Dockerfile that describes the build characteristics. Understanding how [Docker](https://www.docker.com) works is helpful, but you do not need to have it installed locally unless you want to test builds locally.

## Setup OpenShift

The SuDS uses the [OpenShift platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) to host docker containers that contain the:
* üêò Postgres database - stores all of our data
* üîÑ Processing functions - Recurring functions that processes raw sensor data, removes drift, sends flood alerts, etc. Code exists as two repos - [sdfp-processing](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/sdfp-processing) for converting raw pressure data into water depth, and [sdfp-drift](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/sdfp-drift) for removing drift and sending alerts.
* üóÇÔ∏è [Data API](https://api-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs) - How we send data from sensors to database. Code is [here](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/sdfp-api) 
* üì∑ [Photo API](https://photos-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs) - How we send pictures from gateways to our Google Drive storage. Code is [here](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/sdfp-photo-api)
* üìà [Data Viewer](https://sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu) - Visualizes real-time data from sensors and cameras. Code is [here](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/SunnyD-Flooding)

### Structure

Each docker container is its own "Deployment" within OpenShift (the little blue circle thingamabobs in the image below), with each Deployment pulling code from a GitHub repo and building a container. Together, the containers make up a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster.

Here is an annotated screenshot of the setup:
![](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials/blob/main/images/openshift_schema-01.png)

***

‚úèÔ∏è **NOTE**

We use Red Hat's OpenShift platform because we are fortunate to have access through UNC ITS' [Carolina CloudApps](https://cloudapps.unc.edu) program. We have not tested a set up with any other container hosting platform. A similar structure could be created using other container hosting platforms or cloud database systems.

***

### Creating Deployments

To create a deployment:
1. Click `+Add` in the left sidebar
2. To create the Postgres database container, click the `Developer Catalog/Database` option and follow the instructions to build a Postgres database container (w/persistent storage) from an OpenShift-supplied template.
3. To create any of the other containers, click the `Git Repository/Import from Git` option. Paste in the URL of the GitHub repo for the container you want to create (These are linked at the top of this page under [Setting up OpenShift](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/7.-Cloud-Setup#setup-openshift))
4. For any deployment that will need to be accessible from a URL, make sure to set up a **Route** that connects to the proper port for each container. This can be found in the `Dockerfile` in each repo. For example, the port that would need to be exposed with a route for the data viewer would be port **3838** (see [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/SunnyD-Flooding/blob/main/Dockerfile), line 33)

### Environment variables

Each container has a few environment variables that are supplied through OpenShift. This strategy keeps the environment variables secret, so instead of including sensitive password info in your code, your code references an environment variable that is then supplied by OpenShift.

### All environment variables

This is a list of all environment variables needed:

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `GOOGLE_JSON_KEY` | A string denoting the content of a JSON key file that allows access to your Google Account |
| `GOOGLE_SHARED_DRIVE_ID`| The ID of the **shared drive** where images are stored. The ID can be found at the end of the URL of the drive you wish to save images to |
| `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` | The ID of the Google Sheet where flood measurements are automatically written |
| `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` | The ID of the **folder** within the shared drive that you wish to save images to |
| `POSTGRESQL_PORT` | Usually `5432`. Port of your Postgres database |
| `POSTGRESQL_USER` | `Admin` |
| `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` | The password of your Postgres database |
| `POSTGRESQL_HOSTNAME` or `POSTGRESQL_HOST` | Ours is structured `[postgres deployment name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`, replacing the deployment and project names with your own |
| `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE` | The name of your database |
| `MAILCHIMP_KEY` | The Mailchimp API Key |
| `MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID` | The ID of your audience list |
| `MAILCHIMP_INTEREST_ID` | The ID of your audience interest category, which in this case is the location names which people have signed up to receive alerts from |
| `ADMIN_PSWD` | Password to sign in as Admin on Data Viewer to access additional sensor info |
| `FIMAN_URL` | API URL to collect data from [NC FIMAN](https://fiman.nc.gov) gauges |
| `username` | Username to authenticate API usage |
| `password` | Password to authenticate API usage |

This is a list of all environment variables broken down for each container:

#### üîÑ Processing function 

* `GOOGLE_JSON_KEY`
* `GOOGLE_SHARED_DRIVE_ID`
* `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`
* `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`
* `POSTGRESQL_PORT`

#### üóÇÔ∏è [Data API](https://api-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs) 

* `POSTGRESQL_PORT`
* `POSTGRESQL_USER`
* `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD`
* `POSTGRESQL_HOSTNAME`
* `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE`
* `username`
* `password`

#### üì∑ [Photo API](https://photos-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs) 

* `POSTGRESQL_PORT`
* `POSTGRESQL_USER`
* `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD`
* `POSTGRESQL_HOSTNAME`
* `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE`
* `GOOGLE_JSON_KEY`
* `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`
* `username`
* `password`

#### üìà [Data Viewer](https://sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu) 

* `POSTGRESQL_PORT`
* `POSTGRESQL_USER`
* `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD`
* `POSTGRESQL_HOST` - Note this one ends with "HOST". This should be changed to match others in the future
* `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE`
* `ADMIN_PSWD`
* `FIMAN_URL`

### PersistentVolumeClaims

There are **2** PersistentVolumeClaims, which are persistent storage locations that are mounted to a deployment. 

1. `postgresql` - This volume is automatically generated when following the OpenShift template for creating a persistent storage Postgres database. Ours is 2 GiB capacity.
2. `photo-storage` - This volume must be manually created and mounted to the Photo API deployment at the path `/photo_storage`. To do this, click on the upper left `Developer` dropdown tab and select `Administrator`. Expand the `Storage` dropdown on the left sidebar and select `PersistentVolumeClaims`. Click the blue button at the top right of the screen called `Create PersistentVolumeClaim` and follow prompts to name it, select `Shared access (RWX)`, set the size to 2 GiB, and click `Create`. After creation, this volume can be mounted to a deployment by editing the volume. 

## Build Containers

After creating your OpenShift Deployments and Postgres database deployment configuration, you can work locally to update any code served in the containers.

To build a new version of a container:
1. Push your code changes to your GitHub repo that is linked to your Deployment
2. Navigate to you OpenShift Console, click on the `Topology` tab on the left while in `Developer` view.
3. Click on the Deployment that you want to update. A right sidebar will appear - click the `Resources` tab.
4. There will be a subheading called `Builds`, and you can click on the `Start Build` button to build the latest code from GitHub.

## Connect To and Format the Postgres Database

Once you have created your Deployment of the Postgres database container, you can connect to it from your local machine using the OpenShift Command Line tools and pgAdmin.

The SuDS uses particular table names and schema in a Postgres database, and we provide a `.txt` file that can be used to recreate the structure of our database. 

### OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI)

1. Install the CLI following instructions [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli)

***

‚úèÔ∏è **NOTE**

We use the [VS Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com) for the CLI.

***

2. Once installed, follow the [directions to login](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-logging-in_cli-developer-commands)

3. Navigate to your OpenShift Console, the Topology tab, then click on the `postgresql` deployment. A right sidebar will appear - click on the `Resources` tab and note the name of the `Pod`. If your Postgres Deployment is called "postgresql", the pod name will likely be `postgresql-1-[some string of numbers and letters]`. Note the name of this pod.

4. Port forward your local Postgres port that pgAdmin will use to connect to the Postgres pod's `5432` port. You can use the following code in the OpenShift CLI.

```
oc port-forward [insert pod name here] [local port]:5432
```

5. Connect to the remote database using pgAdmin (or another database management software) using your local port that is forwarding to the remote port.

6. "Restore" your database using this `.txt` file (link coming soon. May become a `.sql` file). The `.txt` file is the output of `pg_dump` using the `schema_only` option. 

7. Once you have the database structured, you can move on to adding data & sensor/camera sites! üëá

## Setup Sensors and Cameras

Sensor and camera sites can be set up using the [data API](https://api-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs) and [photo API](https://photos-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs). 

### Adding a sensor site
Sensor site info is stored in a database table called `sensor_surveys`. Make a new site by adding a survey with the `write_survey` function:
1. Navigate to the [data API `write_survey` endpoint](https://api-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs#/default/write_survey_write_survey_post)
2. Click the "**Try it out**" button on the right side of the screen.
3. A window with a JSON array is now editable underneath the heading "**Request Body**". Edit this with the site info that you want to add. **The date_surveyed should be in '%Y%m%d%H%M%S' UTC time.**
4. Press `Execute`

### Viewing sensor site info
1. Navigate to the [data API `get_surveys` endpoint](https://api-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs#/default/get_surveys_get_surveys_get)
2. Click the "**Try it out**" button on the right side of the screen.
3. Fill the `sensor_ID` box with the name of a sensor site (e.g., "BF_01") or "all"
4. Press `Execute`

### Editing a sensor site
This is currently only able to be changed by directly editing the Postgres table. In the future, an API endpoint on the photo API will be created to edit sensor locations.

### Adding a camera site
Camera info is stored in a database table called `camera_locations`. Make a new camera by adding camera info with the `write_camera` function:
1. Navigate to the [photo API `write_camera` endpoint](https://photos-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs#/default/add_a_new_camera_site_write_camera_post)
2. Click the "**Try it out**" button on the right side of the screen.
3. Fill in the required values. `Place` should be the full name of the city and state. For example, **"Carolina Beach, North Carolina"**. The camera ID, should be the letters "CAM", underscore, a two letter abbreviation of the place, another underscore, and a unique two digit number. For example, **"CAM_CB_01"**.
4. Press `Execute`. You should see a "SUCCESS!" response

### Viewing camera site info
1. Navigate to the [photo API `get_cameras` endpoint](https://photos-sunnydayflood.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/docs#/default/get_cameras_get_cameras_get)
2. Click the "**Try it out**" button on the right side of the screen.
3. Fill the `camera_ID` box with the name of a camera site (e.g., "CAM_BF_01") or "all"
4. Press `Execute`

### Editing a camera site
This is currently only able to be changed by directly editing the postgres table. In the future, an API endpoint on the photo API will be created to edit camera locations.
