## Overview

This wiki section includes notes on various precautions mentioned throughout the V2 wiki. Please revisit this section throughout pressure logger and gateway construction, calibration, and deployment. 

## Precautions

### MEAS Jumper 

* Since we are cutting the MEAS Jumper on the OLA, the OLA will always need to be powered by battery. 
* In order to power the OLA from the computer (using a USB) or a lithium battery, the MEAS Jumper pins will have to be connected back together using a jumper shunt. However, if a jumper shunt is applied and the pins are connected back together, make sure the D-Cell battery pack (or other battery) is **not** connected. 
* Thus, having the battery pack disconnected is extremely important when connecting to the computer.
