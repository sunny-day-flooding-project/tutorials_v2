## Tutorial Overview
Once the pressure logger has been constructed, there are several steps that must be taken to update and setup the firmware of the data logger (OLA). These updates are made by communicating with the OLA via a computer and terminal. Note, the OLA settings vary for the pressure logger calibration, connecting the pressure logger electronics to the communications gateway setup, and finally for deployment. Thus, you will need to come back to this wiki to ensure you are using the right settings. 

## Equipment List
Additional to a fully-built pressure logger, you will need the following:
* Jumper shunt, to reconnect the MEAS Jumper on the OLA
* USB-A to USB-C cable, to connect the OLA to the computer
* 90 degree USB-C Male to Female Adapter, to better attach the USB-A to USB-C cable to the OLA

## Open Log Artemis (OLA) Setup

### OLA Firmware
The OLA is an Sparkfun open-source data logger that can interface with our Bar02 pressure transducer. Before updating the OLA settings, make sure you have the latest OLA firmware using the Artemis Firmware Uploader available [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/openlog-artemis-hookup-guide/updating-firmware). <!-- As of 3/28/22 we update the firmware using a custom file created by Ryan so use this instead-->

Some other notes about setup follows:
* We will be using a terminal program, such as Putty or SecureCRT, to connect to the OLA with a USB-C cable. <!-- at UNC, SecureCRT is available -->
* The connection should be serial with a baud rate of 115200. 
* If the baud rate is correct, it will start printing information to the terminal window. 
* To get to the main menu press any key. 
* These settings below will prepare the pressure logger for [Pressure Logger Calibration](../wiki/4.-Pressure-Logger-Calibration). After calibration, settings that need to be changed before the [Communications Gateway Setup](../wiki/6.-Communications-Gateway-Setup) and [Deployment](../wiki/8.-SuDS-Deployment), respectively. 

### Establishing OLA Connection to the Computer
To setup the Pressure Logger, we will be toggling through menus and entering data via the terminal. Thus, we need to setup a connection through a computer. Before connecting to the pressure logger to the computer, review the [Pressure Logger Precautions](../wiki/2.-Pressure-Logger-Precautions) about the MEAS Jumper and battery pack. 
* Configure the OLA as shown in the image below with the jumper shunt the two MEAS prongs and with no batteries installed. 
* Then, connect your computer to the OLA using the USB-A to USB-C cable.

### Main Menu
You will land on a main menu screen that looks like this. Type the number of the menu you want then hit enter to access different configuration menus.

### Menu 1: Configure Terminal Output
The explanation for each option in Menu 1 is below. For quick reference, look at the picture below. 

<img width="600" alt="Main Menu 1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97132847/178189701-ac5ec5cf-d637-4d07-af1a-1a268151d02d.JPG">

* Option 1.3: _9600_
    * After changing the baud rate, you will have to exit the terminal, restart the OLA by holding down on the power button, and then re-connect to the terminal using the new baud rate of 9600. 

<img width="350" alt="establishing new baud rate" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40368514/170120018-8dce66c7-5f3b-45bd-9545-62aa4905896c.PNG">

_Establishing new baud rate and reconnecting to the terminal_

* Option 1.5:  
    * **Set to 1 for [Pressure Logger Calibration](../wiki/4.-Pressure-Logger-Calibration).**
    * **Set to 20 for [Communications Gateway Setup](../wiki/6.-Communications-Gateway-Setup).**
    * **Set to 360 for [Deployment](../wiki/8.-SuDS-Deployment).**
* Option 1.9: _Enabled_ 
* Option 1.10: _129600_
    * controls how frequently data is saved to and output file (.txt)
* Option 1.14: _Enabled_ 
* Option 1.15: _No_ 
    * If using a float switch, set to _Yes_ so that logging frequency increases when the water level passes a certain threshold. Otherwise, choose _No_ for a consistent logging frequency.
* Option 1.21: _15000_ 
    * 15 seconds, or 15000 ms, allows 5 extra seconds after the sample to both transmit the data via BLE and give an opportunity to interrupt the OLA before it goes back to sleep.
    * If option 3.10 is less than 5 seconds, option 1.21 won't be available.

### Menu 2: Configure Time Stamp
The explanation for each option in Menu 2 is below. For quick reference, look at the picture below.

* Option 2.4: _(enter the current date)_ 
* Option 2.6: _(enter the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds)_ 
    * update and double-check this setting before every deployment. 
* Option 2.9: _(enter offset based off your time zone)_ 
    * Our group logs time/date in EST year-round. EST is five hours behind UTC, but your offset will vary depending on your time zone. 

### Menu 3: Configure IMU
The OLA data logger is compatible with many non-pressure sensors. We disable the functionalities that do not pertain to our data.

### Menu 4: Configure Digital Logging
Leave this menu at its default settings. This menu may not appear at all on your Main Menu in the terminal, which is fine.

Menu 6 is composed of several sub-menus. Enter _1_ or _2_ to make edits to Menu 6.1 and 6.2, respectively. 

#### Menu 6.1: Configure MS5837 Pressure Sensor
We only need the raw pressure and temperature data from the pressure logger, so options 4-7 are not used. 

<img width="600" alt="Main Menu 6.1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97132847/178190842-bf840dbd-e494-4e9c-920a-c46ea065742c.png">

## Adafruit Bluefruit LE UART Friend (BLE) Board Setup
Before connecting to the BLE board to the gateway, confirm that the firmware on the board is up to date.
* Install [Bluefruit Connect app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluefruit-connect/id830125974) app on your mobile device.
* Connect your mobile device to the BLE board and check for firmware updates.
* If firmware updates for the board are available, accept them.
