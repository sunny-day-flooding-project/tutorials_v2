## Connections Issues

### Artemis and BLE Boards having difficulty recognizing sensor in a 4-Pin connector: 

1. Using a working probe (baseline) test each of the components to check if they are working.
 * Start with sensor, then the BLE, then the Artemis, and last the carrier board. 
 * When removing boards from the carrier board, use caution. Work the boards out slowly, lifting them a little on each side at a time. If boards are not removed carefully, a pin could be broken.  

2. Check other items:
 * Is the jumper on the Artemis board cut (on top of the row of pins on the working one between the last two pins)?  
 * Is jumper2 jumpered on the bottom of the carrier board? 
 * Is the jumper installed between Pin1 and POUTSW? 
 * Does the BLE module light come on? 
 * Is the jumper cable between the J2, JST and Artemis installed?
 * Has the programming been verified? 
 * The BLE could also just have gone bad. 

How to check the above items: 
 * Power up the board and plug in the USB cable. If the application menu comes up on the screen, the Artemis is powered and running.  
 * Next, verify that the BLE is powering up. Every 15 or so seconds the BLE should light up and then go off. The BLE is turned on and off with the transistor switches on the board. If the BLE is not lighting up, then the sensor is not working correctly.  
     * To verify, using a multimeter, hook the black lead to the ground of the battery or power supply. Look at the test point QOUT1- it should be close to the J2 connector. This is the signal from the Artemis to power up the BLE. It should read 3.3 V every 15 seconds or period of sampling.  
     * If there is voltage being read at the test point but not the BLE then there might be an incorrect transistor in Q1 and Q2.  
     * If there is no 3.3 V on QOUT1 then something is wrong from the Artemis JST to the J2 (or possibly a blown pin on the Artemis.  

3. If all of the above has been checked, check the wiring on the sensor to the 4-pin microfit. 
 * Verify that there is voltage on the J3 pin (pin 1 is ground).

4. If all boards have power and are running correctly, other actions to try include: 
 * Swapping the BLE from this non-working stack with one on a working stack (use caution in removal to avoid pins breaking). This will verify a good BLE.  
 * Repeat above for the Artemis board. 
 * Check Bluetooth connectivity using a phone app. This will check what Bluetooth is sending without the Pi. The phone will display a string of text displayed at the send interval. This is the probe sending data at the programmed interval.  
 * Power the non-working unit with a power supply (4.5 to 5.0 V max). Look at the current. Do the same with the working stack. Compare the current. If the current readings are significantly different, identify what is drawing the extra current by swap testing.  
 * Look at the voltage on J3 pin 2 when things are running. Should be switching on similar to the BLE.  
 * Finally, check if sensor failed or pins 3 and 4 are swapped where soldered onto the sensor board.  

 

 ## Sensor Readings Issues

### Tips to Reduce Noisy Pressure Readings when SuDs are Dry

* Take a wet paper towel and wipe down the sensor measurement point.  
* Cleaning the measurement point reduces the noise when the sensor dries out. This will eliminate the root cause of the issue with the drift correction algorithm misidentifying low part of noisy signal as new dry elevation.  
* Note: This is not an instant fix because the drift correction algorithm is backwards looking.  

### Possible Reasons for Noisy Pressure Readings

* Temperature correction issues (cal coefficients in sensor are no longer accurate to the current state of the sensor)
* Bad sensor 
* Intermittent connection such as bad ground to sensor 
* Slow dissipation of pressures behind the porous stone
* Leak or moisture in the probe
* Fabrication/soldering problem 
* Comms issue related to capacitance issues 
* Too much silicone grease behind the porous stone putting pressure on the element that takes time to dissipate
* Issue with the temperature measurement and cal curves stored in that sensor or failing sensor. 


To isolate these issues, the suspect unit will need to be tested against a correctly working unit. First, setup a test that you can see the effect in the test fixture with the good and suspect units side by side. Then, run the test with the suspect probe with the known good Artemis unit. This would determine if the suspect Artemis is the problem. This process rules out if the Artemis is the problem. If the Artemis is not the problem, it must be the sensor probe. If it is the probe, run some tests without the filter and see if anything changes. If not, then it is best to swap 
out the probe.

Note: **It is best practice to hold a known 'ideal' sensor/Artemis probe for use in validation testing and troubleshooting. 
Test units that are going into the field should be tested against the ideal in the lab prior to deployment.**
