## Tutorial Overview

The pressure transducers used in the SuDS can be sensitive to temperature. Each pressure transducer is calibrated to determine how pressure readings vary with a range of temperatures. This step occurs after the pressure logger has been constructed and the settings have been configured.  Before calibrating, it is recommended that you read through this entire document to prevent having to repeat the experiment for optimal results. Furthermore, make sure the pressure logger is set to the right settings (especially sampling frequency) as outlined in the [Pressure Logger Setup](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/3.-Pressure-Logger-Setup). 


## Equipment 

* Jumper shunt, to reconnect the MEAS Jumper on the OLA
* USB-A to USB-C cable, to connect the OLA to the computer
* 90 degree USB-C Male to Female Adapter, to better attach the USB-A to USB-C cable to the OLA
* Frame for calibration setup 
* A bucket with a depth greater than 20cm 
* Ice (ice water)  
* Aquarium Heater
* Suction Cups 

## Hardware Setup

### Configure the OLA

* Connect the OLA to your computer using a Jumper shunt and USB cable. Before connecting to the pressure logger to the computer, review the [Pressure Logger Precautions](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/2.-Pressure-Logger-Precautions) about the MEAS Jumper and battery pack. 
* Access the terminal (Putty or SecureCRT) and make sure the correct OLA settings are being used for the calibration. As outlined in the Pressure Logger Setup, the only setting that needs to be set specifically for calibration is in [Menu 1](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/3.-Pressure-Logger-Setup#menu-1-configure-terminal-output).
* Connect the pressure transducer to the other end of the QWIIC board while the OLA is still connected to the computer
    * Manually boot the OLA (press button on the board)
    * Reestablish connection to terminal on your computer
    * When opening the terminal, make sure the program recognizes that the Pressure Transducer is attached
    * Configure the OLA settings in [Menu 6.1](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/3.-Pressure-Logger-Setup#menu-61-configure-ms5837-pressure-sensor)
* Disconnect from the computer and power the OLA with the battery pack again. Before inserting the battery pack, review the [Pressure Logger Precautions](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/2.-Pressure-Logger-Precautions)

### PVC Housing
* Check the PVC Housing made during the Pressure Logger Construction. This test must be done after the PVC housing has been fully built. The PVC Housings should be watertight and sealed. Otherwise, water will leak into the PVC housing and damage the electronics.  
* Mark the depth measurement locations on the PVC for calibration

## Experiment Setup and Calibration 

The equipment setup for calibration, the calibration procedure, and the appropriate scripts for temperature calibration can be found in the [sensorCalibration](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/sensorCalibration/tree/main) repository. 
* Before moving forward, the procedures found in the repository should be completed.
