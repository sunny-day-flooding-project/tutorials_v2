## Tutorial Overview

The communications gateway is the part of the SuDS that is installed above the pressure logger in order to capture images of roadway flooding and transmit data to the API. This unit houses a Raspberry Pi 4 computer that connects to the BLE board in the pressure logger. A camera is attached to this Raspberry Pi 4 computer to allow for real-time imaging. This communications box will be installed on a pole near the storm drain with the pressure logger and is powered by the solar panel attached to the unit.

The design files for the gateway are located [here](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/STL-Files-for-3D-Printing,-Send-Cut-Send-Files,-Design-Documents) and indicate which components must be custom-ordered or 3D printed, and include the part numbers of the components that can be ordered from general vendors. These files also specify the dimensions of larger components, such as the gateway enclosure and solar panel.

## Preparing Gateway Support Structure 

### Gateway Enclosure Assembly

This section explains how to begin preparing the gateway housing as well as the metal strutting that will connect the gateway to a tree or pole; additionally, this preparation should be done prior to [SuDS V2 Deployment](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/8.-SuDS-V2-Deployment). 

First, gather the following items: 

* Battery enclosure
* Optical Dome
* Weld on Acrylic (in a squeeze bottle)
* Drill bit (3 ¾ Inch) 
* Drill Press 

Note that the battery enclosure dimensions should fit the following drawings: 

Take the polycase battery enclosure and drill out a hole to fit the optical dome.  

* Note: This is to be done using a drill press with a 3 ¾ drill bit to drill the appropriate size hole in the top of the polycase box where the optical dome will go. The size of the hole should accommodate the optical dome so that the rim of the optical dome can sit flush with the inside edge of the hole.  

The hole should have a 3.85" diameter, and the center should be 6.5" inward from either edge of the box, and down 4.0". See photo below. 

<img width="300" alt="Location of hole in polycase for dome installation" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/af450c20-be87-4cf1-aa70-b6648ad1d786"> 


Once the hole has been drilled, clean both the inside and outside of the polycase box and the lens using a shop towel with degreaser.  

* While cleaning and completing the following steps, be sure to wear gloves.  

Take the lens and ensure the lens will fit into the cut hole prior to beginning gluing.  

Once the lens has been inserted into the hole in the polycase with the back of the lens facing the inside of the box, fill a squeeze bottle with weld on acrylic. 

* Using the squeeze bottle, apply the weld on acrylic around the outer edge of the dome on the inside of the box lid. Allow the acrylic to set.  
* Once the acrylic is set on the inside of the box, flip the lid over and use the squeeze bottle to apply acrylic to the front edge that is flush with the hole. Allow the acrylic to set.  

<img width="300" alt="Optical dome orientation in polycase box" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/a515a316-54e1-4c25-8150-f7dbb28fa138"> 

_Optical Dome Orientation in Polycase Box_ 

To ensure that the lens has a proper watertight seal, run water under the installed lens and watch for air bubbles. If no air bubbles appear, the acrylic has formed a sufficient seal.  

### Sun Shield Attachment 

Gather the following items: 

* Drill with 9/64 drill bit
* Compressed air canister 
* Thread Sealant 
* 8-32x 3/4 Phillips Screws (6)
* 8 Flat Washers (6)
* 8-32 Lock Nuts (nylon insert nuts) (6)
* 11/32 Driver 
* Sun Shield 

First, place the sun shield just above the lens. The sun shield should be horizontally parallel to the top of the lens. Reference the photo below for placement. Then, mark where the screws will go through the sun shield on the gateway box, and remove the sun shield. Prepare to drill holes for the screws in the gateway box. 

Using the 9/64th drill bit, drill over the marked locations on the gateway box. Next, deburr the holes and use the air canister to air blast the holes. After air blasting the holes, coat the screws with the thread sealant. Put the sun shield back into place, and screw the screws through the previously drilled holes. Once the screws are in place, place a flat washer over the ends of each screw. Finally, use the 11/32 nut driver to secure a lock nut on the end of each screw as well. The sun shield should now be secured to the front of the gateway box. 


### HDPE Board and Uni-Strut Preparation 

Prior to beginning backboard assembly, take a piece of plywood and create a template for the nail locations that will be used to attach the backboard to the metal struts. Mark and drill holes into the plywood so that it can be laid on top of a piece of the HDPE black backing board and maintain nail locations.   

* Note: Nail locations are dependent on strut length, dimensions of the polycase box, and how the box will be attached to the pole or tree in deployment.  

 Gather the following items: 

*  HDPE Black Backing Board  
* 307 Grade A Hex Bolts HDG (¼"-20x1 ½" PT) (8) 
* Plywood Nail Template 
* 3/8 Galvanized Flat Washers (4) 
* ¼ Galvanized Flat Washers (4) 
* ¼ Galvanized Split Washer (4) 
* ¼- 20 Galvanized Nuts (4) 
* Uni-strut pieces needed to set up gateway  
* Galvanizing spray 

To begin preparing the HDPE backing board, put the HDPE black backing board on a pallet and lay the template plywood on top of the prior to drilling.  

First, drill holes in the corner holes in the template and insert 307 Grade A Hex bolts into the corners to hold the black backing board into place while drilling the remaining holes into the board.  

* The actual alignment of the plywood template on the board does not have to be a perfect fit so long as the holes are in vertical alignment 

<img width="300" alt="HDPE Board Setup" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/9d60867d-40fa-4294-bd03-4569d42f93b4"> 

_Drilling HDPE Board_ 

Then, take the polycase battery box with the lens attached and ensure that the feet have been attached correctly to the bottom of the box. If the feet have not yet been attached, screw the feet into the bottom of the box in the orientation shown below. Also, ensure that the clamps for the gateway box have been placed onto the sides of the box. If not, slide the clamps into place on the sides of the box as shows in the bottom left of the photo. 


<img width="300" alt="HDPE Board Setup" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/130f1640-51f2-4edc-9d6e-465a55637abb"> 

Once the feet have been attached, place the polycase box over the correct holes in the HDPE black backing board and place the 3/8 galvanized flat washer over the hole in the foot and then insert the hex bolt. Repeat this for the remaining 3 feet holes.  

Then, lift up the HDPE board and hold the bolts in place. On the bottom of each hex bolt, screw on a ¼ galvanized flat washer, ¼ galvanized split washer, and a ¼-20 galvanized nut. These bottom pieces will be reassembled on the bottom once it is time to assemble the HDPE onto the uni-struts.  


<img width="300" alt="Bolt stack for box feet" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/2052a35c-d7ef-452c-9c38-931110d15da0"> <img width="300" alt="Bolt orientation in HDPE board" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/431898dd-9ee7-4201-90c8-2b3110ad0376"> 

_Bolt Assembly for Attaching Gateway Enclosure_ 

Take the cut uni-struts that will be used to assemble the gateway. Prior to assembly, coat the end of each strut with galvanizing spray to prevent corrosion and rust on the exposed end of each strut. Allow the galvanizing compound to dry. 

* Depending on the spray, it may take approximately 15 minutes for the spray to dry. 

### Uni-Strut Assembly 

Gather the following items:  

Uni-strut: 
* 28" (1) 
* 22" (3) 
* 22.5" (3) 

Other items: 
* Previously assembled bolts for Gateway Box Feet  
* 3/8 Galvanized Flat Washer (4) 
* 307 Grade A Hex Bolts HDG (4) 
* (¼"- 20x ½" PT) (4) 
* ¼ Galvanized Flat Washer (4) 
* ¼ Galvanized Split Washer (4) 
* ¼- 20 Galvanized Nut (4)  
* 3/8"-16 X 1" thread. 1" Diameter Threaded Eye Bolt (2) 
* 3/8 bolt (1" Diameter) Wide Flat Washer Galvanized (2) 
* 3/8 Split Lock Washer Galvanized (2) 
* 3/8-16 Hex Nut Galvanized  (2) 
* 3/8-16 x 1 Hex Head Bolt Galvanized (8) 
* 3/8 bolt (1" Diameter) Wide Flat Washer Galvanized (8) 
* 3/8 Split Lock Washer Galvanized (8) 
* 3/8-16 Strut Channel Nut Galvanized with Spring (8) 

 

Prior to attaching the strutting to the gateway, ensure that the gateway has been secured to the HDPE backing board.  

First, take the 3 22" struts and lay them vertically on a flat surface. Align the 28" strut parallel to the others. Ensure that all the strut is flipped so that the strut channel is facing away from the surface (for example, facing towards you).  Then, take the 3 22.5" struts and lay them horizontally on top of the 4 vertically aligned strutting. Flip these pieces of strut over as well, so the flat side (the side without the channel) is resting on the other pieces of strut. Once the horizontal pieces of strut are in place, group the vertically aligned struts into sets of two and  outward so that the above horizontal pieces of strut are almost flush with the edges of the vertical strut. Move one horizontal strut downward so it is parallel to the bottom edges of the vertical struts and falls over the second hole from the bottom in the vertical struts. Move two of the horizonal struts upward so that two of them are parallel to the top edge of the vertically aligned struts. Align one of the horizontal struts over the second hole from the top in the vertical strut, and align the other horizontal strut directly underneath the top horizontal one. Align the third horizontal strut over the third hole from the top in the vertically aligned struts. For visual of how to align all the strut pieces together, see the below picture. 

<img width="300" alt="Gateway Strut Diagram 1" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/a47fc3c1-8abe-4d2f-ac6a-6ab47c531a15"> <img width="300" alt="Gateway Strut Diagram 2" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/5f53189c-15c3-4cc4-8cb8-5a804d61e562"> 


Prepare to begin bolting all the struts together. Note that all of the bolt locations in the struts have been highlighted in the picture above to help with positioning.  

The bolts for this section have been highlighted in green.  

Grab 12 of each of the following items:  

* 3/8-16 x 1 Hex Head Bolt Galvanized  
* 3/8 bolt (1" Diameter) Wide Flat Washer Galvanized 
* For 3/8 Split Lock Washer Galvanized 
* 3/8-16 Strut Channel Nut Galvanized with Spring 

Starting in the top left corner of the strut pieces, place a 3/8 bolt (1" Diameter) Wide Flat Washer Galvanized over the first hole from the left in the top horizontal strutting. Insert a 3/8-16 x 1 Hex Head Bolt Galvanized  so that the top is flush to the inside of the channel in the strut. While holding the strut in place and gently lifting up the struts, screw a 3/8 Split Lock Washer Galvanized over the bottom of the screw and then follow with the 3/8-16 Strut Channel Nut Galvanized with Spring. Repeat the same process for the hole directly to the right of the bolt just installed.  

Note: If the bottom horizontal strut falls out of place, either put it back in the correct position or leave it off until it is time to start installing bolts in the strut.  

Once the two holes in the top left corner of the struts have bolts in place, repeat the same process for the two holes in the top right corner that are second from the top of the vertical struts. These bolts should be horizontally in line with the other bolts that were previously put in place. The above photo also shows the relative positioning of where the bolts should go.  

Gently lift up the second horizontally aligned strut (the one directly underneath the one that was just bolted). Starting with the hole that is first from left (directly underneath the first bolt installed) in the strut underneath the one that was lifted up (third in line from the top of the vertical strut), create the same bolt stack in the slot in the strutting. Place a 3/8 bolt (1" Diameter) Wide Flat Washer Galvanized over the hole, and then insert a 3/8-16 x 1 Hex Head Bolt Galvanized  so that the top is flush to the inside of the channel in the strut. Screw a 3/8. Split Lock Washer Galvanized over the bottom of the screw and then follow with the 3/8-16 Strut Channel Nut Galvanized with Spring. Once again, repeat the same process for the hole directly to the right of the bolt just installed.  

Once those two bolts are installed into place, repeat the same process for the two holes in the top right corner that are second from the top of the vertical struts. These bolts are horizontally in line with the bolts that were just installed. Then, once all the correct top bolts are put into place, move down to the bottom left hand corner of the strut system. Lift up the horizontal piece of strut, and starting in the second hole up from the bottom in the leftmost piece of strut (where the horizontal piece of strut was covering), install the same bolt. Repeat the same process for the slot directly to the right, and the same for the rightmost two holes that are aligned horizontally with the other two bolts.  

The bolts for the next section are highlighted in pink.  

First, take the HDPE board with the gateway box attached and remove the ¼ galvanized flat washer, ¼ galvanized split washer, and ¼- 20 galvanized nut from the bottom of each bolt that has been inserted through the feet of the gateway box. Keep the gateway box connected to the HDPE board. Place the gateway box and HDPE board over the top of the strut system so that the HDPE board is flush to the side of the struts without the channel (the flat top of the struts).   

Then, align the gateway box feet (with the bolts still in place) over the third holes-inward from the edges of the bottom strut and the horizontal strut directly above the bottom horizonal one. The picture above shows (in pink) where the feet bolts should be placed. Screw the ¼ galvanized flat washer, ¼ galvanized split washer, and a ¼-20 galvanized nut back onto the bottom of each bolt. This should secure the gateway to the strut frame.  

(insert picture of gateway here)  

The bolts for the next section are highlighted in orange.  

Gather 2 of each of the following items:  

* 3/8"-16 X 1" thread. 1" Diameter Threaded Eye Bolt 
* 3/8" bolt (1" Diameter) Wide Flat Washer Galvanized 
* For 3/8 Split Lock Washer Galvanized 
* 3/8-16 Hex Nut Galvanized  

Also grab 1 of the:  

* Hook and Loop Cable Tie with Buckle 1" Wd 3ft Long 

First, locate the middle slots in the outermost two vertical pieces of strut. These slots are the sixth slot up from the bottom of each of the strut pieces, and they are highlighted in orange on both the front and back views of the gateway. Starting from the front in the leftmost hole, insert the 3/8" -16x1" thread. 1" Diameter Threaded Eye Bolt through the front of the gateway structure. On the bottom of the bolt, twist on a 3/8" bolt (1" Diameter) Wide Flat Washer Galvanized, 3/8" Split Lock Washer Galvanized, and a 3/8-16 Hex Nut Galvanized, in that order.  

Repeat the same action for the rightmost slot, so that two of the same bolt stacks have been installed in the middle slots in the outermost vertical struts. Once both bolts are properly secured, take the Hook and Loop Cable Tie with Buckle 1" Wd 3ft Long. This will be used once the whole gateway box has been properly attached to the strutting, and everything inside the box has been setup correctly.  

Take the cable tie, and loop it through both holes in the threaded eye bolts. Pull the cable tie until it is tight, and the gateway box has been fully secured to the gateway strutting.  

Note that the cable tie may be left off if the gateway is fully secured otherwise.

Note before starting: The battery back plates will be mounted on the side of the box that does not have the holes for wiring and the plates should be adjacent to the closest side in vertical alignment with the previously installed dome. The battery back plates will be installed under the dome that was installed in the door of the gateway box. 

Start with the polycase battery enclosure that has already been assembled with the dome glued to the inside. Take one of the battery back plates and the mounted solar panel controller. The battery back plate should be aligned horizontally, and the solar controller should be placed on so that the edge of the solar controller does not cover the two rightmost lines of holes in the mounting plate. See the photo below for the proper alignment (see below). Remove the 4 4-40 7/16" SS Panhead screws and 4-40 SS Lock nuts from the bottom of the screws. Using the orientation described above, re-screw in the  4 4-40 7/16" SS Panhead screws through the holes in the resin mounting plate as well as the battery back plate. Screw the 4-40 SS Lock nuts onto the screw ends located below the battery back plate to secure the solar panel controller to the battery back plate. 

Then, take the assembled battery plate with the solar controller on it and align the plate with the back, and bottom edge of the gateway box. Make note of where the holes in the corner of the mounting plate align with the holes in the bottom of the box.   

<img width="300" alt="Location of Bottom Battery Backplate" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/a9304d65-67ca-4f09-88c4-32e3b7d027fd">

_Placement of Battery Backplate in Gateway Box_


The back bottom holes in the box already have threads. The holes that are horizontally aligned and are not in the back corners are not (bold) pre-threaded. These must be threaded prior to installing the 4  larger aluminum standoffs. Using the tap and die set, match the threading to fit on the inside of the holes in the bottom of the box and the Send-Cut Send Standoffs. Note that the standoffs have been threaded on the inside to allow for 10-32 ½" SS Pan head screws. 

Once the holes have been properly threaded, realign the mounting plate with the solar controller towards the back over the threaded holes and insert and screw in the 4 aluminum standoffs, securing the mounting plate into place. Prior to screwing in standoffs, make sure the alignment of the Solar Controller on the mount matches the one in the photo above.  

Next, take the remaining battery back plate and the DIN rail. Cut the DIN rail to fit onto the top of the battery backplate. The leftmost edge of the DIN rail should be just to the right of the second leftmost hole (disregarding the holes in the corner) in the first row on the top of the plate. The rightmost edge of the DIN rail should fall to the left of the hole in the corner of the battery back plate. Place the DIN rail on top of the battery backplate in the previously mentioned alignment.  

Then, take two of the 4-40 7/16" SS Panhead screws, two of the .375 x .125 x .05/.08 SS washers, and two of the 4-40 SS lock nuts. Place one of the washers on top of one of the leftmost slots in the DIN rail so that the washer is also directly over one of the holes in the battery backplate. Then, insert one of the screws through the washer, DIN rail, and battery backplate. Screw one of the lock nuts onto the bottom of the Panhead screw, securing the DIN rail to the top of the battery backplate.

_Attaching the DIN Rail_

Repeat this procedure using one of the rightmost slots in the DIN rail to secure the other side of the rail to the top of the battery backplate as well. This second screw installation is shown in the photo above. 

Being mounting the camera and pi stack to the DIN Rail. Take the camera angle mounting bracket, one of the DIN rail mounting clamps, the two remaining 4-40 7/16" SS Panhead screws and the two remaining 4-40 SS lock nuts. Flip the DIN rail mounting clip over and place it so that the flat edge is directly over the two holes in the bottom of the angle bracket. Insert the panhead screws into the two holes in the end of the mounting clamp so that the threading of each screw is exposed above the surface of the angle bracket. Screw the two lock nuts on top of the screw threads until the lock nuts are flush to the surface of the angle bracket. Check that the DIN rail mounting clamp is fully secured to the camera angle mounting bracket.

_DIN Rail for Camera Angle Mounting Bracket_


Take the ball mount for the camera module and the camera lens. Attach the ball mount to the slot in the camera angle mounting bracket, so that the large black end of the ball mount is facing the inside of the angle mounting bracket. Place the ball mount so that it is flush with the top edge of the slot in the angel bracket. Then, take the Raspberry Pi camera module. Remove the cap on the module and attach it to the large black end of the ball mount. Point the camera module towards the power supply.  

Once the cap has been attached to the ball mount, unlock the ribbon holder and attach the camera ribbon cable to the Raspberry Pi camera. Ensure that the metal slits of the camera ribbon cable align with the ribbon holder on the camera. Minimize bends in the ribbon.  

Remove the cap on the Raspberry Pi camera lens and attach the lens to the camera module. Leave the lens cap on to protect the lens. The adjustment piece that comes with the lens is not needed.

_Removing Additional Component from Camera_ 


When the camera module has been attached to the camera angle bracket, attach the camera system to the DIN rail by sliding the DIN rail mounting clip onto the DIN rail.   

<img width="300" alt="Attached Camera System" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/0f0d8768-ba6e-4436-91ba-d1cf825619de"> 

_Camera System_


Once the camera has been mounted to the DIN rail, prepare to mount the Pi stack adjacent to the camera mount. Take the assembled Pi stack, the remaining DIN rail mounting clip, and two of the 4-40 7/16" SS Panhead Screws and 4-40 SS Lock Nuts. 

First, flip the Pi stack over so that flat Pi mount plate is facing upwards and the shorter side of the plate is parallel to the edge of the table. Similar to the camera angle bracket, place the DIN rail mounting clip flush to the surface of the Pi mount plate (both flat edges touching) and orient the rail mounting clip so that the two holes in the mounting clip are directly over the second vertical line of unfilled holes in the Pi mount plate. The holes fall in between standoff pillars in the assembled Pi stack. 

Insert the 4-40 7/16" SS panhead screws through the holes in the DIN mounting rail clip. The screw threads should be exposed above the surface of the Pi mounting plate. Once the screws are properly in place take the 4-40 SS lock nuts and twist them onto the end of the screw threads. Check that the DIN rail mounting clip has been properly secured to the bottom of the assembled Pi stack.    


Like with the camera system, attach the Pi stack to the DIN rail by sliding the DIN rail mounting clip onto the DIN rail.  

Once the Pi stack is secured to the DIN rail, take the unattached end of the camera ribbon holder and attach it to the proper location in the Pi stack. 
 
<img width="300 " alt="Location of Camera Ribbon in Pi" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/a423df08-1546-4dd6-8ff8-b9fbad3f76a0">

The camera system and Pi stack should now be fully attached to the DIN rail. Once both the camera and Pi have been mounted to the DIN rail, the antennas on the Pi can be taped to the side of the box to safely secure them out of the way.

### Battery and Cable Assembly

Before attaching the battery cable, the battery cable must first be attached. 

Gather the following items: 

* YETOR SAE Connector, SAE to O Ring Terminal Harness 
* 14 AWG Connectors Cable Compatible with SAE 30cm 2 Pin Single Plug Quick Disconnect
* 14 AWG SAE DC Power Automotive Connector Cable Y Splitter 1
* 3.3VDC, 22 Ga Red (Red Wiring)
* Ground, 22 Ga black (Black Wiring) 
* Male mini-fit crimp contacts (2) 
* Female mini-fit connector  
* Heat Shrink 
* Prongs (from solar panel charge kit) 

First, take two of the 14 AWG cable connectors.  

Take one, and strip the ends off the exposed wire ends so that there is enough wire exposed to solder a new connection. Then, take the previously used spools of red and black wiring and cut off a sufficient length (reference photos below) of both the red and black wiring. Strip both ends of each piece of red and black wiring. Solder one end of the red wiring to the exposed end of the red wire in the cable connector, and apply heat shrink over the newly soldered connection. Repeat the same thing with the black wiring.

Once both ends of red and black wiring have been soldered, crimp the remaining exposed wire ends into male mini-fit crimp contacts. Finally, insert these contacts into a female mini-fit connector.  

<img width="300" alt="Battery Cable Segment 1" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/ecb89242-75d0-4094-834f-c39352da6093"> 

Take the other 14 AWG cable connector, and strip the ends off the exposed wire ends so that there is enough wire to solder a new connection. Solder the prongs that came with the solar panel charge kit on here.  Apply red heat shrink over the red connection, and black heat shrink over the black connection.  

<img width="300" alt="Battery Cable Segment 2" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/6b459dfe-3fb8-4846-b04a-05f7b91dc81a"> 

Next, take the YETOR SAE Connector, SAE to O Ring Terminal Harness, 14 AWG SAE DC Power Automotive Connector Cable Y Splitter 1, and both segments of assembled wiring. Connect them as seen in the following picture: 

<img width="300" alt="Battery Cable Connections" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/b0a88d08-7a64-45be-8f7a-f68dfdfd0975"> 

The final completed battery cable should look like this:  

<img width="300" alt="Completed Battery Cable" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/8d686dea-edfb-49a4-b57b-13b724615655">

Once the battery cable has been properly assembled, it can be attached to the battery and Pi stack when it is time to use the gateway system. To attach the cable to the battery and Pi stack, first, take the assembled battery cable and open the covering on the screws screwed into the solar mount. This might be labeled with stickers 'solar' and 'battery'.  

<img width="300" alt="Solar Mount" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/3f27b4e2-2048-4743-ac03-53337b4d48f4">

Unscrew the screws under the 'solar panel' label. If the covering was not labeled, these are the two screws on the rightmost side of the black paneling. Take the pronged ends (nodes) of the assembled battery cable and insert the black wire node into the rightmost slot (-) and insert the red wire node into the slot directly to the left (+).  

Next, take the 2-pin connector portion of the assembled battery cable and insert it onto the end of the 2-pin connector wired to the Pi Stack. The black wiring in both cables should match up, for example, the black wiring pin in the Pi stack wiring should match up with the black pin wiring from the assembled battery cable. Note that the photo below does not show the pins properly connected, only the location of where the red and black nodes should be placed when it is time to setup the gateway. 

<img width="300" alt="Battery Connection" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/0da74e69-d23e-4d7b-b0a0-d3849e170dcd"> 

Next, prepare to connect the battery cable to the battery. When placing the Durcell Deep Cycle Battery 55Ah into the gateway, place the battery into the bottom of the gateway while it is vertically upright. Take the assembled battery cable and the two ends of the cable with metal hoops attached to the bottom. There should be a red end and a black end. These correspond to the red square block and the black square block with the positive and negative terminals on the battery. Place the red wire hoop on the red terminal and the black wire hoop on the negative terminal.

## Final Gateway Assembly

### Solar Panel Pole Assembly



Prepare to attach the solar panel to the solar arm system. First, take the top portion of the mounting pole and insert it through both of the green plastic holders on the solar arm. The pole threads should be directed downward. For an example of what this is supposed to look like, see the leftmost example of the completed [solar panel arm](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/5.-Communications-Gateway-Construction#solar-panel-arm). Next, adjust the green holders to get the solar panel arm to approximately 45 degrees before installing the solar panel.  

To do this, use the photo below.  

<img width="300" alt="Solar Panel Attachment 1" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/e3c72a70-6a64-4492-a005-56bb2029e9b7"> 

The key to achieving the desired angle is to both separate the mounting points labeled C as much as possible and to shorten the bottom strut as much as possible. The bottom strut may be cut prior to constructing the solar arm to get the angle as low as desired.  To shorten the strut without cutting, loosen the bolt labeled A, push it in as far as it will go, and re-tighten the bolt. To separate the mounting clips as much as possible (the length labeled C) loosen the bolts at B and slide them as low as they will go and re-tighten.  

<img width="300" alt="Solar Panel Attachment 2" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/819b9095-fc1b-44dd-99ca-6465c501c633"> 

_Optimal 45 Degree Angle_ 

<img width="300" alt="Solar Panel Attachment 2" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/398a4db6-a284-46a6-af74-d83d3cf93524"> 

_Approximate distance between edge of strut and hinge to achieve the desired angle around the location marked B_ 

Once the angle of the solar panel arm is approximately 45 degrees, prepare to attach the solar panel to the gateway.  

 
Gather the following parts: 

* Solar Panel Cross Member ¼" Aluminum (2)
* 3/8-16 x 1.5" Phillips Flat Head Screw 18-8 Stainless (4) 
* 3/8-16 Hex Nut Galvanized (4) 
* For 3/8 bolt. (1" OD) Wide Flat Washer Galvanized (4)
* For 3/8 bolt Split Lock Washer Galvanized (4) 
* 8-32 x 3/8" phillips pan head screw (4)
* For 8-32 screw flat washer (4)
* For 8-32 Screw Split Lock Washer Stainless Steel  (4)
* 5/16-18 galvanized nut (2) 

Begin by attaching the first solar panel cross member.

To start, unpack the solar panel box. Take out the solar panel, and flip it over so that the longer edge is vertical and the shorter edge is horizontal. Grab the two aluminum solar panel cross-members, and slide them underneath the edge of the solar panel. Each should be about 1/4 of the way up from the bottom and top edges of the panel, aligned underneath the holes in the sides of the solar panel. 

<img width="300" alt="Solar Panel Cross Members Alignment" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/5ed80d54-bfd3-41d7-a40d-277063bbac7a"> 
 

Next, gather the 8-32 x 3/8" Phillips pan head screw (4), 8-32 flat washer (4), and the 8-32 stainless steel split lock washer (4). To secure the aluminum solar panel cross members to the solar panel, insert a split lock washer and then a flat washer onto the bottom of each screw. Insert the screw stack through each of the 4 holes in the back of the solar panel and into the aluminum cross members. The flat washer should be flush to the edge of the solar panel side. The cross members should now be secured to the back side of solar panel. 

<img width="300" alt="Back of Solar Bolt Stack 1" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/c645dad3-22d7-4f47-b9c6-d47b0dd6b481"> 

Next, gather the 3/8-16 x 1.5" stainless steel Phillips flat head screws 18-8 (4), 3/8-16 galvanized hex nuts (4), for 3/8 bolt. (1" OD) galvanized wide flat washers (4), and the 3/8 bolt galvanized split lock washers (4). Also, grab the constructed solar arm. Align the solar panel over the parallel lengths of strutting on the solar arm so that the strutting falls along the center of the solar panel. The solar panel should sit just below the top edge of the strutting, and there should be a slight excess of strut extending below the solar panel. Flip the solar panel and solar arm over so that the solar panel can be secured to the solar arm. 

<img width="300" alt="Solar Panel Alignment" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/e66461b6-06ef-41ee-bf23-76368e1f48cd"> 
 
Ensure that holes in the parallel lengths of strutting fall over the solar panel cross members. On the end of each flat head screw, place a galvanized hex nut, a galvanized split lock washer, and a galvanized wide flat washer in that order. Insert each assembled bolt through the strutting and into the solar panel cross members, with two bolts for each of the cross members. Tighten the bolts into place. 

<img width="300" alt="Back of Solar Panel Stack 2" src="https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/assets/133719453/70010111-a11b-49a6-ba1a-d9ccf02dcb40">

Once the solar panel has been attached to the solar arm, take the whole solar arm system and prepare to attach it to the extended length of strutting on the gateway (in the [Design Documents](https://github.com/sunny-day-flooding-project/tutorials_v2/wiki/STL-Files-for-3D-Printing,-Send-Cut-Send-Files,-Design-Documents) this is the second strut from the right). Align the holes in the solar panel pole with the holes in the strut. The solar panel should be facing away from the gateway, as seen in the documents. Align the pole so that the top of the extended strut is just parallel to the bottom green plastic holder.

Then,  insert two 5/16"-18x4 Galvanized Carriage Bolts into the bottom two holes in the mounting pole and through the holes in the gateway strut. Then, Insert in the following order on the threaded end of each bolt: galvanized flat 3/8" washer, galvanized flat ¼" washer, galvanized 3/8" split washer, and 5/16-18 galvanized nut. The threaded end of the bolts should be exposed on the same side the mounting place is installed. The solar arm system should now be attached to the gateway system.
